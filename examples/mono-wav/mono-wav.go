/* Simple analysis on a monophonic single frequency WAV file
 * Returns a channel of type Pitch.
 * The type Pitch carries the Hop number at which the analysis is made, the pitch detected at that Hop, the confidence of the detection. 
 * Based on the detected pitch, the closest standard tuning(A4:440 Hz) frequency and the standard midi number are alo returned.
 * pitch of -1 is returned in case of silence or failure to detect the time period by the algorithm.
 * Pitch is analysed for every chunk of size defined by the third parameter, the hopSize
 * The hopSize is time-frequency trade-off. For better time resolution, use a smaller chunk size. 
 * However, this would limit the detection of lower frequencies.
 * 
 * Theoretically, you would want 2*SamplingRate/FrequencyToBeDetected number of samples for analysis.
 * So, with 2048 chunk size, you are looking at about 43 Hz lowest possible frequency.
